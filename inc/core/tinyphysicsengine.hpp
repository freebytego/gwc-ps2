/**
  tinyphysicsengine (TPE)

  Simple/suckless header-only hybrid 3D physics engine with no floating point,
  only 32 bit int arithmetic, similar to e.g. small3dlib.
  
  Conventions and formats are the same or similar to those of small3dlib so as
  to make them easily integrate with each other.

  The library works with bodies made of spheres connected by elastic springs,
  i.e. soft bodies which however behave as "stiff" bodies by default and can
  be used to fake rigid body physics as well. Bodies are placed in environemnts
  specified by a distance function that allows to implement any mathematical
  shape.

  Orientations/rotations are in extrinsic Euler angles in the ZXY order (by Z,
  then by X, then by Y), if not mentioned otherwise. Angles are in TPE_Units,
  TPE_FRACTIONS_PER_UNIT is full angle (2 PI). Sometimes rotations can also be
  specified in the "about axis" format: here the object is rotated CW by given
  axis by an angle that's specified by the magnitude of the vector.

  Where it matters (e.g. rotations about axes) we consider a left-handed coord.
  system (x right, y up, z forward).
